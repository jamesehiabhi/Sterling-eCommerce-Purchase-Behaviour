The Sterling Customer Purchase Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of purchase behaviour, payment trends, and regional performance, offering valuable insights into the companyâ€™s overall performance in 2021 and 2022. Below is a detailed breakdown of key findings and actionable observations derived from the dashboard:

#### 1. Total Purchase Amount and Growth Trends
- The company achieved **$231 million** in total purchase revenue, with a significant proportion **(68%)** contributed by **2022**. This indicates strong year-over-year growth, emphasizing Sterling's ability to scale operations and attract new customers effectively.

#### 2. Customer Loyalty and Engagement

- Sterling successfully retained **56%** of its customers as **loyal buyers**, while attracting **44%** new customers. This balance between loyalty and new customer acquisition highlights the companyâ€™s robust customer retention strategies and appeal to fresh market segments.

#### 3. Top-Performing Product Categories

- The highest contribution to quantity ordered comes from **Mobiles & Tablets**, followed by **Men's Fashion** and **Superstore**. This suggests that technology and fashion dominate customer demand.

- Categories like Books, School & Education lag significantly, presenting an opportunity to explore untapped market potential through targeted promotions.

#### 4. Payment Preferences

- **EasyPay** leads as the most-used payment method, followed by Bank Alfalah and EasyPay_Vouchers, collectively making up the majority of transactions. This trend underscores the importance of seamless, digital payment solutions for Sterlingâ€™s customers.

- Alternative methods like Finance Settlement and Cash at the Doorstep are less utilized, suggesting a potential to promote these for customer convenience.

#### 5. Regional Purchase Trends

- The **South region** leads in purchases with **$90 million**, significantly outperforming other regions like the Midwest ($63 million) and the Northeast ($40 million). This indicates strong regional loyalty and an opportunity to replicate success strategies in other underperforming regions, such as the **West ($39 million)**.

- Focused marketing campaigns and tailored offerings for the Midwest and West regions could further balance regional revenues.

#### 6. State-Level Insights

- Among states, **Texas ($18 million)** and **California ($16 million)** dominate the sales chart. These two states alone account for a substantial share of revenue. This concentration suggests the need to diversify efforts to penetrate markets in lower-performing states, such as Missouri and Kentucky, which show growth potential.

- States like New York and Pennsylvania perform moderately well but could benefit from customized engagement campaigns.

#### 7. Monthly Sales Seasonality

- The end-of-year months (**November and December**) show the highest spikes in sales and quantities ordered, likely driven by holiday shopping and promotions.

- Months like February and June reflect lower performance, indicating a seasonal lull. Introducing mid-year promotions or events can help boost activity during these periods.

## Strategic Recommendations

ðŸš€	**Regional Optimization**: Deploy region-specific marketing initiatives for the West and Northeast to reduce dependency on top-performing regions like the South.

ðŸš€	**Customer Retention Programs**: Leverage data on customer preferences to improve retention rates among new customers and increase the loyalty base beyond 56%.

ðŸš€	**Payment Method Diversification**: Promote alternative payment options, such as finance settlement, to reduce over-reliance on top-performing methods.
